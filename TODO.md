## Feature Ideas

* New map gets private + public (read-only) url
* New feature type text (is this a point with 'hide icon'?)
* Map properties: Name, description
  * Initial location center, zoom
  * Base map selector
* Editor for feature properties (name, description, style)
  * Select icon for pointer, icon upload
* Image upload as feature property, read geolocation
* Multi-select (change all at once)
* Filter view by feature group / category
* Map Tour (define steps with descriptions)
* geojson import / export
* document geojson spec extension
* Text listing of map features
* Show pointer or connected state of other users


Data Integrations:

* On uploading geojson, define how property keys map to ourmaps properties
* Connect to external APIs, define mapping
  * Provide example json apis with moving points features
* Upload spreadsheet
