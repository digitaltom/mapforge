When you are browsing maps, the background maps can get configured to get loaded from external providers, such as opentopomap.org, stadiamaps.com, arcgisonline.com, openstreetmap.org, openfreemap.org, versatiles.org and maptiler.com. Those providers have their own policies which can get accessed via the info link in the lower right corner of the map.

### As a logged in user

We only collect what we need and that we will solely process this information to provide you with the Mapforge service.

Here’s what that means in practice. When you log in via one of the supported login providers (Github, Google), we store:

    Your name
    Your email address
    Your profile picture
    Your login provider

A persistent first-party cookie is stored to remember you’re logged in.

### As a map creator of Mapforge

The geojson and image data you upload or create on Mapforge is available to other users
by default. You can decide to configure your map as private, then it is only
available to others that know the private or public link to it.

Users are responsible for any data they share through Mapforge and confirm that they have the permission to share it.

You can export all your map data in GeoJSON format.


### Retention of data

We will retain your information as long as your account is active.

You can choose to delete your Mapforge account at any time by sending a mail to mapforge@digitalflow.de. All your data will be permanently deleted immediately when you delete your account.
